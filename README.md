# Picture-In-Picture
Android 8.0 (API level 26) allows activities to launch in picture-in-picture (PIP) mode.

You can drag the PIP window to another location. When you tap on the window two special controls appear: a full-screen toggle (in the center of the window) and a close button (an "X" in the upper right corner).
